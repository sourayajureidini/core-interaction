      <p> Kayak’s website which’s mission is to provide travel planning tools such as flights, hotels… is built upon practicality and simplicity to fasten the process of finding and buying the product/service.
The structure of the website makes it easy to navigate. Its simple, well organized and only includes a minimum amount of information.
The fact that only the buttons are blue or orange shows how colors can be functional. It indirectly guides the customer’s browsing. It triggers clicks, which then narrows the search down and makes it easier to find the service that works best.

         <h2> <a href= "http://www.johos.at"> JoHo's </h2> </a>
          <p>JoHo’s is a bean brand from Brazil. Their website is interactive, includes high quality imagery, story telling, videos and sounds.  The website as as whole tells the story behind a beans journey.
The structure and design of the website clearly shows that its main purpose is to be visually appealing, to captivate the viewer. The story is communicated through the aesthetics.
The website as a whole is not structured enough which makes it challenging to navigate. The size of the type and the lack of buttons invites the viewer to experiment without any guidance which turns the website into a personal experience.</p>

         <h2> <a href="http://www.mikiyakobayashi.com"> Mikiya.com </h2> </a>
            <p>Mikiya is a product designer. He uses a minimalistic approach to his portfolio to showcase his work. He uses animation, photography and a saturated color palette which is visually satisfying and extremely charming.
The project section is a combination of all of images of his work, shot individually. However, the images blends together perfectly, the page as a whole feels organic and complete. On the other hand it makes it harder to locate a specific project since the page includes a bunch of images one after the other. If one is looking for information about a specific item, scrolling down and clicking on the images is the only way to do it. </p>

<h2> <a href="http://www.latimes.com" > LAtimes.com </h2> </a>
          <p>
The LA times is another example that values “form follow function”. Despite its cleanliness,  the website is very well organized and functional.
The white boxes are used to organize the information, dividing each articles into sections.
The use of the different type and weight sizes creates a hierarchy. It invites the viewer to read the title instead of the paragraphs. It makes it is easier and faster to decide on which  article to read.
The fact that the photographs are the only colorful </p>
