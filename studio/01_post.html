            <div class="introduction"> During the post war period, <br> magazines were the main mean of <br> communicating,
            lifestyle and social ideals. </div>

            <div class="body">  The increase of “leisure time resulting from a shorter week in business and industry”, improvements in transportation,
                paid vacations, and so on affected the growth of the Magazine industry. <br> </br>It had created more time to consult and read them.
                Women who had served in the labor force, went back home. Thus World War II and “the propaganda of Rosie the Riveter” inaugurally provided
                opportunities for women to work and participate in activities that didn’t necessarily involve their household.

                <br> <br> As a result popular magazines were used to re-appropriate  gender roles. It portrayed <div class="debt"> “the ideal women”
                </div> stereotype by emphasizing  the traditional concepts of femininity. It exemplified “the concept of women’s total fulfillment through
                their role as housewife and mother”.

                <br>  <br> <div class="quote"> Women were expected to feel accomplished by being passive. </div>
                Magazines and Advertising were one of the primary forces behind the creation of “the ideal women” considering that it illustrated the exemplary
                life at home by only advertising home products, making women better domiciliary consumers.
                It portrayed women shopping rather than working, and projected woman in need of male recognition and appreciation.
                Thereupon popular imagery was used as propaganda to acquire social control in the Post War period. </body>
