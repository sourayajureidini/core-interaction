                    Women entered the work force, for the first time they were attributed a place in society that went beyond their families and households.
                     Not every women took part in the War effort, but those who did, were the focus of the publics eye.
                    <br> <br> Women’s magazines general topics involved women who stayed at home but some of them , did show “images
                    of women wearing military clothes and nursing uniforms”  which also helped promoting America’s involvement in the war.
                    <br> One might wonder why were magazines so present in women’s life in the first decades of the first century ?
                    <br> <br> <div class="quote"> Women were introduced to these publications during childhood because it was providing an ideal image on how perfect life could be. </div>
                    “A whole fascinating world of fiction, illustrations, cover paintings, advertisements with pictures of houses, far-off-places,
                    healthy babies in great numbers  there is hardly any childhood world comparable to it except that of mail-order catalogue or a well stocked attic”
                    <br> <br> The stories and imagery in magazines were all about  safe environments, happy families, intriguing new products, appetizing food…  which offered
                    “nostalgia about the past, and hope for the future.
