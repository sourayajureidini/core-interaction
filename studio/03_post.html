      <p>Women entered the work force, for the first time they were attributed a place in society that went beyond their families and households.  Not every women took part in the War effort, but those who did, were the focus of the publics eye.
  <p>    Women’s magazines general topics involved women who stayed at home but some of them , did show “images of women wearing military clothes and nursing uniforms”  which also helped promoting America’s involvement in the war.
