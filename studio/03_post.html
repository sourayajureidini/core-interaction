            <div class="introduction"> World War II did bring great changes <br> in men and
            women’s life in the United States </div>


            <div class="body">
                    Women entered the work force, for the first time they were attributed a place in society that went beyond their families and households.
                     Not every women took part in the War effort, but those who did, were the focus of the publics eye.
                    <br> <br> Women’s magazines general topics involved women who stayed at home but some of them , did show “images
                    of women wearing military clothes and nursing uniforms”  which also helped promoting America’s involvement in the war.
                    One might wonder why were magazines so present in women’s life in the first decades of the first century ?
                    <br> <br> <div class="quote"> Women were introduced to these publications <br> during childhood because it was providing an ideal <br> image on how perfect life could be. </div>
                    “ A whole fascinating world of fiction, illustrations, cover paintings, advertisements with pictures of houses, far-off-places,
                    healthy babies in great numbers  there is hardly any childhood world comparable to it except that of mail-order catalogue or a well <br> stocked attic”
                    <br> <br> The stories and imagery in magazines were all about  safe environments, happy families, intriguing new products, appetizing food…  which offered
                    “nostalgia about the past, and hope for the future.
