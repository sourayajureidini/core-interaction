            Looking back at history, social stereotypes were always omnipresent in societies.
            In the 1900’s the female beauty idea was defined the curves and soft lines of the body.
            To do so women used to intensely wear corsets which created the desired figure. <br> However it did create damages : the tightness of corset could even harm the internal organs of the women.
            <br> <br> Over the years the female ideal was completely redefined. In the 1920’s women got rid of their corsets and adapted to a more boyish look. Hair were cut short, symbolizing a sort of freedom of expression since women were given new rights in society.
         However it is crucial to acknowledge the pressure and struggle of these women to fit in society.     Women had to be thin and beautiful.
                <br> <br> <div class="quote">They were expected to o fit into <br> “a mold” in order to be included socially. </div>
                    Furthermore Mass advertising was emphasizing this type of behavior by popularizing and idealizing the female stereotype of the 1920 which of course, created a greater amount of pressure on women.
            <br> <br> Fashion was also another factor that set the new standards. Clothes were designed only for a certain body type whereas in the previous years clothes were designed according to each person’s body.
            The fashion for women during that time period embraced a “boyish figure that lacked hips, breasts and defined waits”
