        <div class="title"> Body Shaming </div>


        <div class="introduction">

            Naturally Mass Media sets specific <br> standards through popular imagery (Advertising, magazines..)
            <br>  and therefore creates insecurities within society
        </div>


        <ul class="flex-container">

          <li class="flex-item">
              It started with the Victorian era. Society was even back then, fixated on beauty, little waits, big butts..
              <br> Until the 1970’s Advertisers were not only diminishing women’s role in society in order to sell their product but
              <br> used  ‘body shaming” as one of their tactics.
              For example the on the right side of the page is calling out “girls with too much bottom and too little top”. <br>The intention behind the
              ad is to let the consumer know that Warners can “take your misshapen body and remold it into something socially acceptable”
              Grape nuts cereal also commissioned a series of problematic and sexist in the 1950’s.
               In order to sell the product
              and services they made a clear statement that fat means bad.  On the right side the poster we can see a thin, smiling
              women holding a floral dress.
              On the left side a bigger women is portrayed however she seems unhappy and jealous.
              <br> The idea behind this specific use of imagery is to tell the potential the consumer that in order to be happy you need
              to be skinny and therefore eat some post grape nut.
