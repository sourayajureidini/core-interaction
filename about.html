            I was born in Paris in 1995 and raised in Beirut, Lebanon.  My background and upbringing has had an indelible influence <br>on my work and perspective as an artist.
            This kaleidoscopic childhood made me sensitive to the arts as I now work as a graphic designer and a street life photographer on the side.

            </span>

           <br> <br>  <span class="paragraph-2"> I find beauty in so many different things: objects, buildings, humans, anything at all. Living in a country with that much history
        and authenticity influenced the love i feel towards history itself.<br> <br> </span>

        <span class="paragraph-3">
        I appreciate anything that is vintage which <br> is consciously and unconsciously reflected it in my work aesthetics.
        I often use modern layouts and bright colors.  I consider my designs minimalistic. 
        </span>

        <span class="paragraph-4">  <br> <br> My photography is colorful and symmetrical which comes from my appreciation for architecture and geometrical shapes.
            <br> I embrace photographing things that seemed basic, ordinary and which are largely taken for granted.
